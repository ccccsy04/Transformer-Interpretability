        "This notebook / document is built around the [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper, in which the authors aim to understand the **indirect object identification circuit** in GPT-2 small.

        "It is loosely divided into different sections, each one with their own flavour. Sections 1, 2 & 3 are derived from Neel Nanda's notebook [Exploratory_Analysis_Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens/blob/main/demos/Exploratory_Analysis_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=WXktSe0CvBdh). The flavour of these exercises is experimental and loose, with a focus on demonstrating what exploratory analysis looks like in practice with the transformerlens library. They skimp on rigour, and instead try to speedrun the process of finding suggestive evidence for this circuit. The code and exercises are simple and generic, but accompanied with a lot of detail about what each stage is doing, and why (plus several optional details and tangents). Section 4 introduces you to the idea of **path patching**, which is a more rigorous and structured way of analysing the model's behaviour. Here, you'll be replicating some of the results of the paper, which will serve to rigorously validate the insights gained from earlier sections. It's the most technically dense of all five sections. Lastly, sections 5 & 6 are much less structured, and have a stronger focus on open-ended exercises & letting you go off and explore for yourself.\n",

        "A key idea to have in mind during these exercises is the **spectrum from simpler, more exploratory tools to more rigoruous, complex tools**. On the simpler side, you have something like inspecting attention patterns, which can give a decent (but sometimes misleading) picture of what an attention head is doing. These should be some of the first tools you reach for, and you should be using them a lot even before you have concrete hypotheses about a circuit. On the more rigorous side, you have something like path patching, which is a pretty rigorous and effortful tool that is best used when you already have reasonably concrete hypotheses about a circuit. As we go through the exercises, we'll transition from left to right along this spectrum."

        "\n",
        "The first step when trying to reverse engineer a circuit in a model is to identify *what* capability we want to reverse engineer. Indirect Object Identification is a task studied in Redwood Research's excellent [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper (see [Neel Nanda's interview with the authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo) or [Kevin Wang's Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587601532639494146.html) for an overview). The task is to complete sentences like \"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to\" with \" Mary\" rather than \" John\".\n",
        "\n",
        "In the paper they rigorously reverse engineer a 26 head circuit, with 7 separate categories of heads used to perform this capability. The circuit they found roughly breaks down into three parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Identify what names are in the sentence\n",
        "2. Identify which names are duplicated\n",
        "3. Predict the name that is *not* duplicated\n",
        "\n",
        "Why was this task chosen? The authors give a very good explanation for their choice in their [video walkthrough of their paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo), which you are encouraged to watch. To be brief, some of the reasons were:\n",
        "\n",
        "* This is a fairly common grammatical structure, so we should expect the model to build some circuitry for solving it quite early on (after it's finished with all the more basic stuff, like n-grams, punctuation, induction, and simpler grammatical structures than this one).\n",
        "* It's easy to measure: the model always puts a much higher probability on the IO and S tokens (i.e. `\" Mary\"` and `\" John\"`) than any others, and this is especially true once the model starts being stripped down to the core part of the circuit we're studying. So we can just take the logit difference between these two tokens, and use this as a metric for how well the model can solve the task.\n",
        "* It is a crisp and well-defined task, so less likely to be solved in terms of memorisation of a large bag of heuristics (unlike e.g. tasks like \"predict that the number `n+1` will follow `n`, which as Neel mentions in the video walkthrough is actually much more annoying and subtle than it first seems!).\n",
        "\n",
        "A terminology note: `IO` will refer to the indirect object (in the example, `\" Mary\"`), `S1` and `S2` will refer to the two instances of the subject token (i.e. `\" John\"`), and `end` will refer to the end token `\" to\"` (because this is the position we take our prediction from, and we don't care about any tokens after this point). We will also sometimes use `S` to refer to the identity of the subject token (rather than referring to the first or second instance in particular)."

You are recommended to keep a document or page of notes nearby as you go through these exercises, so you can keep track of the main takeaways from each section, as well as your hypotheses for how the model performs the task, and your ideas for how you might go off and test these hypotheses on your own if the notebook were to suddenly end.\n",

Imagine a line of people, who can only look forward. Each person has a token written on their chest, and their goal is to figure out what token the person in front of them is holding. Each person is allowed to pass a question backwards along the line (not forwards), and anyone can choose to reply to that question by passing information forwards to the person who asked. In this case, the sentence is `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`. You are the person holding the `\" to\"` token, and your goal is to figure out that the person in front of him has the `\" Mary\"` token.\n",
        "\n",
        "To be clear about how this analogy relates to transformers:\n",
        "* Each person in the line represents a vector in the residual stream. Initially they just store their own token, but they accrue more information as they ask questions and receive answers (i.e. as components write to the residual stream)\n",
        "* The operation of an attention head is represented by a question & answer:\n",
        "    * The person who asks is the destination token, the people who answer are the source tokens\n",
        "    * The question is the query vector\n",
        "    * The information *which determines who answers the question* is the key vector\n",
        "    * The information *which gets passed back to the original asker* is the value vector\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, here is how the IOI circuit works in this analogy. Each bullet point represents a class of attention heads.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The person with the second `\" John\"` token asks the question \"does anyone else hold the name `\" John\"`?\". They get a reply from the first `\" John\"` token, who also gives him their location. So he now knows that `\" John\"` is repeated, and he knows that the first `\" John\"` token is 4th in the sequence.\n",
        "    * These are *Duplicate Token Heads*\n",
        "* You ask the question \"which names are repeated?\", and you get an answer from the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. You now also know that `\" John\"` is repeated, and where the first `\" John\"` token is.\n",
        "    * These are *S-Inhibition Heads*\n",
        "* You ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\". You get a reply from the person holding the `\" Mary\"` token, who tells you that they have name `\" Mary\"`. You use this as your prediction.\n",
        "    * These are *Name Mover Heads*\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a fine first-pass understanding of how the circuit works. A few other features:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The person after the first `\" John\"` (holding `\" went\"`) had previously asked about the identity of the person behind him. So he knows that the 4th person in the sequence holds the `\" John\"` token, meaning he can also reply to the question of the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. *(previous token heads / induction heads)*\n",
        "    * This might not seem necessary, but since previous token heads / induction heads are just a pretty useful thing to have in general, it makes sense that you'd want to make use of this information!\n",
        "* If for some reason you forget to ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\", then you'll have another chance to do this.\n",
        "    * These are *(Backup Name Mover Heads)*\n",
        "    * Their existance might be partly because transformers are trained with **dropout**. This can make them \"forget\" things, so it's important to have a backup method for recovering that information!\n",
        "* You want to avoid overconfidence, so you also ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\" another time, in order to ***anti-***predict the response that you get from this question. *(negative name mover heads)*\n",

So if we perform singular value decomposition $W_Q W_K^T = U S V^T$, then we see that we can just as easily define $W_Q = U \\sqrt{S}$ and $W_K = V \\sqrt{S}$ and use these instead. This means that $W_Q$ and $W_K$ both have orthogonal columns with matching norms. You can investigate this yourself (e.g. using the code below).

You really, really want to avoid needing to think about tokenization wherever possible when doing exploratory analysis (though, of course, it's relevant later when trying to flesh out your analysis and make it rigorous!).

I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (e.g. the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending to a single John token.

        "\n",
        "And we should be able to identify duplicate token heads by finding ones which attend from `\" John\"` to `\" John\"`, and whose outputs are then moved to the `\" to\"` token by V-Composition with another head (Spoiler: It's more complicated than that!)\n",

        "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",

And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant. See [my clean GPT-2 implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Clean_Transformer_Implementation) for more on LayerNorm.\n",

It also really surprising that there are *negative* heads - eg 10.7 makes the incorrect logit 7x *more* likely. I'm not sure what's going on there, though the paper discusses some possibilities."

Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can then iterate over many possible activations and look at how much they affect the corrupted run. If patching in an activation significantly increases the probability of the correct answer, this allows us to *localise* which activations matter.\n",

        "The ability to localise is a key move in mechanistic interpretability - if the computation is diffuse and spread across the entire model, it is likely much harder to form a clean mechanistic story for what's going on. But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent."

The results of denoising are much stronger, because showing that a component or set of components is sufficient for a task is a big deal. On the other hand, the complexity of transformers and interdependence of components means that noising a model can have unpredictable consequences. If loss goes up when we ablate a component, it doesn't necessarily mean that this component was necessary for the task. As an example, ablating MLP0 in gpt2-small seems to make performance much worse on basically any task (because it acts as a kind of extended embedding; more on this later in these exercises), but it's not doing anything important which is *specfic* for the IOI task."

Patching by replacing corrupted residual stream values with clean values is a causal intervention which will allow us to understand precisely which parts of the network are identifying the indirect object.

        "\n",

        "* Tip - it's good practice to have `model.reset_hooks()` at the start of functions which add and run hooks. This is because sometimes hooks fail to be removed (if they cause an error while running). There's nothing more frustrating than fixing a hook error only to get the same error message, not realising that you've failed to clear the broken hook!"

Within this frame, the first attention layer doesn't do much.\n",

        "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [Neel's walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition."

They cause token `S2` to attend to `S1+1` (mediated by the previous token heads), and their output is used as both a pointer to `S1` and as a signal that `S1` is duplicated (more on the distinction between these two in the paragraph \"Position vs token information being moved\" below).\n",

This is an example of **built-in redundancy** in the model. One possible explanation is that this resulted from the model being trained with dropout, although this explanation isn't fully satisfying (models trained without dropout still seem to have BNMHs, although they aren't as strong as they are in this model).

Although this is mostly true, it turns out that there is a bit of K-composition happening in these heads. We can think of this as the duplicate token heads writing the \"duplicated\" flag to the residual stream (without containing any information about the identity and position of this token), and this flag is being used by the keys of the S-inhibition heads (i.e. they make `END` pay attention to `S2`). In the diagram, this is represented by the dark grey boxes (rather than just the light grey boxes we had in the simplified version). We haven't seen any evidence for this happening yet, but we will in the next section (when we look at path patching).\n",

If we didn't count MLPs as a direct path then we wouldn't catch this causal relationship. The drawback is that things get a bit messier, because now we're essentially passing a \"fake input\" into our MLPs, and it's dangerous to assume that any operation as clean as the one previously described (with vectors $v$, $w$) would still happen under these new circumstances.\n",

We compute the proportion of samples that contain the input name token in the top 5 logits (N = 1000) and call this the copy score.

To explain why intuitively, heads might be \"expecting\" non-zero input, and setting the input to zero is essentially an arbitrary choice which takes it off distribution. You can think of this as adding a bias term to this head, which might mess up subsequent computation and lead to noisy results. We could also use mean-ablation (i.e. set a head's output to its average output over `ioi_dataset`), but the problem here is that taking the mean over this dataset might contain relevant information for solving the IOI task. For example the `is_duplicated` flag which gets written to `S2` will be present for all sequences, so averaging won't remove this information.\n",

We'd like to conclude that these are induction heads, and they're acting to increase the attention paid by `end` to `S2`. Unfortunately, they don't seem to be induction heads according to the results of figure 18 in the paper (which we replicated in the section \"validation of early heads\").\n",

A more rigorous way to test this would be to path patch to the keys of these heads, and see if either of the previous token heads have a large effect. If they do, this is very strong evidence for induction. However, it turns out that neither of the prev token heads affect the model's IOI performance via their path through the fuzzy induction heads. Does this invalidate our hypothesis?\n",
        "\n",
        "In fact, no, because of nonlinearity. The two prev token heads `2.2` and `4.11` will be adding onto the **logits** used to calculate the attention probability from `S2` to `S1+1`, rather than adding onto the probabilities directly. SO it might be the case that one head on its own doesn't increase the attention probability very much, both both heads acting together significantly increase it. (Motivating example: suppose we only had 2 possible source tokens, without either head acting the logits are `[0.0, -8.0]`, and the action of each head is to add `4.0` to the second logit. If one head acts then the probability on the second token goes from basically zero to `0.018` (which will have a very small impact on the attention head's output), but if both heads are acting then the logits are equal and the probability is `0.5` (which obviously has a much larger effect)).\n",

The same effect can be found when we patch from these heads to all four induction heads, although it's even more pronounced (a 3% and 15% drop respectively for the heads individually, vs 31% for both).\n",

If we run the model but intervene to set a specific head to zero, what happens? If the model is robust to this intervention, then naively we can be confident that the head is not doing anything important, and conversely if the model is much worse at the task this suggests that head was important. There are several conceptual flaws with this approach, making the evidence only suggestive, e.g. that the average output of the head may be far from zero and so the knockout may send it far from expected activations, breaking internals on *any* task.

Relative positional information on the other hand will mostly have fewer dimensions. Since the model only needs to move enough information to single out a single positional index from about 15-20, rather than single out a name in the entire set of names.
